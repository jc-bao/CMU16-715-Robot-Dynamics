# CMU-16-715-Robot-Dynamics
Lecture notes for CMU 16715 Advanced Robot Dynamics. 

## Overview

- Describe a system: Newton-Euler, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian
- Simulate a system: 
- Contact: simulate contact and friction. 
- Understand simulator: why it diverges, why it is not deterministic, why the contact not act the way we want, what could be the sim2real gap.
